# PyLatticeIO

Read and write lattice QCD data in Python with [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy).

This repository contains Python implementations to read and write different lattice QCD data such as gauge configurations and propagators generated by [Chroma](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/chroma) software.

Just loading data into NumPy format is useless, and you should use these I/O samples along with your analysis script.

## Supported format

| Software   | Gauge      | Propagator | Other |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Chroma     | Read       | Read       |       |
| MILC       | Read       | Read       |       |
| KYU        | Read/Write | Read/Write |       |
| IO General |            |            | Read  |
