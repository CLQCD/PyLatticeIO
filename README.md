# PyLatticeIO

Read and write lattice QCD data in Python with [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy).

This project was originally the I/O part of [PyQUDA](https://github.com/CLQCD/PyQUDA), and I simplified the code to create this repository. This might be helpful to analysis lattice QCD data in Python.

This repository contains Python implementations to read and write different lattice QCD data such as gauge configurations and propagators generated by [Chroma](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/chroma) software.

Just loading data into NumPy format is useless, and you should use these I/O samples along with your analysis script.

The propagator will be rotated to DeGrand-Rossi basis.
